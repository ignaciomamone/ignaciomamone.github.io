However, defaults are recurrent, some debtor countries take a lot of time to end them, and some extract costly concessions from investors. This article argues that these differences are largely explained by the political regimes in the borrowing countries. While previous research examines whether democracies make more credible commitments, we analyze how democracies affect bargaining with foreign investors after a default occurs. Democracies, with their institutional checks, electoral uncertainty, greater transparency, and public deliberation, make swift decision-making harder, create incentives to pander and posture, and give leverage to minimize the win set of viable agreements. We test our theory on a comprehensive dataset of debt restructurings with private creditors in the period 1975-2017. The event history analysis indicates that democracies experience longer restructurings and the double-hurdle estimation shows that democracies obtain larger creditor loses. Further, there is interesting variation among democracies and autocracies. Our findings suggest that political regimes are crucial to explaining why cooperation fails in international debt markets.","tags":null,"title":"Time for a Haircut: Political Regimes and Sovereign Debt Restructurings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Mamone","Jose Incio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"b977287734fed4e4e63757f03536cfb3","permalink":"/publication/canon/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/canon/","section":"publication","summary":"How do extractive natural resources affect political competition? Previous research claims that natural resources lead to less democratic rule. However, context can constrain what rulers do to stay in power. We study how natural resource revenue affects local elections within a democratic country that experienced a commodity price shock. We argue that state capacity and social mobilization restrain incumbency advantage in districts benefited by windfall revenue. We employ an original dataset covering 1,649 municipalities during the 2010 and 2014 elections in Peru. We find that incumbents obtain more votes in districts receiving high resource transfers but that the effect turns negative in districts which more employed professional civil servants before the windfall. Further, incumbents have no advantage in districts with social protests triggered by resource extraction. Our findings add to a growing literature exploring the subnational political consequences of natural resources.","tags":null,"title":"Natural Resource Revenue and Incumbency Advantage: Evidence from Peruvian Municipalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Mamone","Amy Erica Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b482fd73ae0cbae09c64155acf8639e4","permalink":"/publication/chapter/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chapter/","section":"publication","summary":"As both candidate and president, Donald Trump has expressed views that aim to restrict cross-border flows. Trump's general skepticism of the movement of people and goods between the U.S. and Latin America at times have led him to diverge from prior administrations and at others to continue earlier policies. Dating at least from the mid-twentieth century, prior administrations sought to increase legal trade and support diversity in legal immigration from Latin America, while vigorously opposing the illegal drug trade and illegal immigration. Trump, by contrast, has taken an isolationist and populist approach to US–Latin American relations. The chapter deals with U.S. policy toward three types of cross-border flows: trade, immigration, and drugs.","tags":null,"title":"Crossing Borders: United States Foreign Policy in Latin America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Mamone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6c0d1fc311e5998923ebafc653a5297b","permalink":"/publication/de18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de18/","section":"publication","summary":"The last military dictatorship in Argentina established an Industrial Promotion Regime that deepened state intervention and offered tax subsidies to firms originated in the postwar industrialization process. The policy contradicted the dictatorship's explicit goals of fiscal adjustment and market liberalization. Why would a dictatorship seeking to destroy an industrial coalition grant rents to domestic firms? Previous studies claim that the dictatorship was either a puppet of international financial institutions or the armed branch of traditional landowners. Such views omit the policy consequences behind the choice of specific institutions that the armed forces adopted to share power. This paper analyzes historical archive documents from the 1976-1977 sessions of the Comision de Asesoramiento Legislativo, a military-run quasi-legislative body, to explain how the decisionmaking process affects industrial policy. The evidence shows how three key actors in the authoritarian coalition advanced their opposite interests as the industrial reform was designed. The statist faction of the armed forces, large national businessmen, and economic technocrats shaped the timing and content of the new legislation, leading to the adoption of a crucial economic policy which contradicted the foundational objectives of the authoritarian regime.","tags":null,"title":"Authoritarian Institutions and Industrial Policy: The Political Economy of Industrial Reform during the Argentine Dictatorship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Mamone","Lucas Gonzalez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"738a28fccde25d5eb90ad5398ad131c5","permalink":"/publication/laps/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/laps/","section":"publication","summary":"Using original data from the period 1999–2011 on federal infrastructure investment for all subnational units in two federations, Argentina and Brazil, and a unitary nation, Colombia, this study shows that in developing federal countries with strong governors, presidents use nonearmarked transfers as a tool to compensate governors for sizable and secure territorial political support. The study argues that in these cases, resources do not make electoral power but chase it. In the unitary case, conversely, governors do not influence distributive politics. Variation also was found in the relevance of Congress, legislative overrepresentation, and programmatic criteria across cases.

To what extent do other political actors, such as legislators and governors, influence federal distribution? This paper studies the main factors that affect distributive politics in Argentina and Brazil, two highly unequal presidential federations in Latin America. The focus is on funds with high redistributive impact and over which the central government has large discretion: those for public infrastructure. Using original data on federal infrastructure spending for the 24 provinces in Argentina and the 27 states in Brazil for the period 1999-2011, we show that the distribution of infrastructure funds is fundamentally determined by executive politics. Despite this, our empirical findings indicate there is large variation between the two cases in the relevance of the partisan links between presidents and governors and the influence of congress and its committees. Furthermore, we observe that elections are not relevant in explaining distribution in either of the two cases and that presidents are mostly motivated by political considerations and that programmatic factors, such as equity and efficiency criteria, play a secondary role, especially in Argentina. We discuss some possible reasons for these results and their implications for the broader comparative debate on distributive politics.","tags":null,"title":"Who Distributes?

Although the relative worsening of some economic indicators affected the votes received by the ruling party in the legislative elections, this did not substantially alter the composition of seats in Congress. The President could put forward her legislative agenda with this legislative support. However, the positive image of the president eroded in public opinion polls. Facing fiscal pressures and a relatively weakened president, governors deepened their coordination efforts against the central government. As a result, one of the central features of Argentine politics in 2013 was the intensification of the conflict between the president (a primus) and the governors (her peers).","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal Pressures and Partisan Conflict in Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio Mamone","Lucas Gonzalez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"910fe1e99e3360666a3d4d88fd1308fb","permalink":"/publication/de11/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/de11/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies the political and economic determinants in the federal allocation of infrastructure grants among provinces in Argentina. We focus on public works because these transfers have a large redistributive impact and because the central government has significant discretionary power in their allocation. Using original data for the 24 provinces between 1993 and 2009, this article explains how the regional distribution of public works relies on the political incentives presidents face to build and maintain territorial electoral coalitions and legislative majorities. We show that these factors are more important than programmatic ones associated to equity or efficiency criteria. The data show that neither variables associated to Congress' influence nor overrepresentation strongly influence the distribution of funds, contrary to what some studies have identified for the U.S. and the European Union, respectively. Our main argument is that presidents in Argentina tend to be economically inefficient, socially regressive, and politically conservative when distributing public works. The redistributive impact in poor districts is only meaningful when governors from these districts are crucial political allies and when they represent a safe political investment for the president. We discuss the implications of our findings for the comparative debate.","tags":null,"title":"La economía política de la distribución federal de obra pública en Argentina","type":"publication"}]
